This repository contains all the working code for both the master and slave Arduino to build the ApolloBVM. Feel free to fork it for your own development, we encourage collaboration! All mechanical parts and assembly instructions can be found [here](http://oedk.rice.edu/apollobvm).

For those looking to just download and run the code, please refer to the [releases](https://github.com/apollobvm/apollobvm/releases) section and downloaded the latest firmware. Currently, we are working the last few bugs and will be putting up an initial release shortly. For the time being however, please clone this repo.
