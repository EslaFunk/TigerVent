# TigerVent #
## A Ventilator design inspired by Rice University's ApolloBMV with added Alarming and Pressure Sensing

Enhancements from base ApolloBMV Design:
* Honeywell NSCDRRN001PDUNV Pressure Sensor integrated with driver
* Assist control mode that triggers the ventilator when negative pressure (a breath) is initiated
* Alarm and code to handle alarms based on pressure (WIP)
* Schematic and Board files for printed circuit board designed in EAGLE (confirmed tested and working)
* alternate LCD driver implementation for more available 2004 LCD Screen
* Powershell script to automate updating library in seperate folder while also maintaining git capability
