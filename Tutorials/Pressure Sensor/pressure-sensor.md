### Pressure Sensor:

For our pressure sensor, we decided to get the Honeywell NSCDRRN001PDUNV. This pressure sensor has a +-1 PSI range, which is +-70.307cm H2O. This is within range of the generally accepted maximum allowed 40 cm H20. This is a differential pressure sensor with two pressure inputs. The top plug is connected to the Ambu bag, and the bottom plug is left open to the atmosphere. This allows for the pressure to always be consistent.
